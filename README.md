## Pair with OpenClaw Agents

This skill provides **tools**. For **roles** (PM, Developer, Designer, etc.), pair with [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) agents that share personality, methodology, and cross-project experience.

```
Roles (OpenClaw)  → ~/.openclaw/agents/     # who does the work
Skills (this)     → ~/.claude/skills/       # what tools they use
```
