# Tooling Tips

Practical setup and usage notes for the LLM Wiki stack.

## Obsidian setup

### Essential settings

1. **Attachment folder**: Settings → Files and links → "Attachment folder path" → `raw/assets/`.
2. **New file location**: Settings → Files and links → "Default location for new notes" → `wiki/concepts/`.
3. **Download attachments hotkey**: Settings → Hotkeys → search "Download attachments" → bind to `Ctrl+Shift+D`. After clipping an article, hit the hotkey to download all images locally.

### Plugins to install

- **`plugins/obsidian-audit/`** (this repo) — select text → add feedback → writes to `audit/`. See "Audit plugin" section below.
- **Obsidian Web Clipper** (browser extension) — converts any webpage to Markdown and saves to your vault. Configure to save to `raw/articles/`.
- **Dataview** (optional) — query frontmatter fields; build dynamic tables of articles by tag, date, source count.
- **Marp** (optional) — render wiki content as slide decks directly from Obsidian.

### Graph view

Graph view (`Ctrl+G`) is the best way to see your wiki's shape:
- Dense hub = a well-connected concept page.
- Isolated node = orphan page (needs inbound links or removal). `lint_wiki.py` flags these.
- Cluster = a sub-topic worth a dedicated folder-split under `wiki/concepts/`.

## Audit plugin — `plugins/obsidian-audit/`

Installs into a local Obsidian vault. Workflow:

1. Build the plugin once:
   ```bash
   cd plugins/obsidian-audit
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
2. Symlink (or copy) the plugin folder into your vault:
   ```bash
   npm run link -- "/path/to/your/vault"
   ```
3. In Obsidian, enable Community Plugins, then enable "LLM Wiki Audit".
4. In the plugin settings, set:
   - **Wiki root** — path relative to the vault root (usually `.`).
   - **Audit directory** — path relative to the wiki root (default `audit`).
   - **Author** — your name.

Commands (bind to hotkeys if you like):
- **`Audit: Add feedback on selection`** — opens a modal with severity + comment → writes an audit file.
- **`Audit: List open feedback for current file`** — shows a notice summarising open audits targeting the current file.
- **`Audit: Open audit folder`** — reveals `audit/` in the file explorer.

The plugin uses the shared `audit-shared` library, so files it writes are byte-identical in shape to files the web viewer writes.

## Web viewer — `web/`

Local Node.js server that renders the wiki with mermaid, KaTeX, and wikilinks, and lets you file feedback from your browser.

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run build
npm start -- --wiki "/path/to/wiki-root" --port 4175
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4175`. Features:
- Left sidebar: navigation tree built from `wiki/index.md`.
- Main pane: rendered markdown, mermaid diagrams rendered client-side, formulas rendered server-side.
- Right sidebar: list of open audits for the current page.
- Select any text → "💬 Add feedback" popover appears → submit → writes an audit file to `<wiki-root>/audit/`.

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only. No auth; intended for personal use on your own machine.

## Obsidian Web Clipper usage

1. Install from [obsidian.md/clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper).
2. Configure template to save to `raw/articles/`.
3. Clip an article → hit the download-images hotkey → file is ready for `ingest`.

For complex pages (paywalled, dynamic): copy-paste the main text manually, save as `raw/articles/<slug>.md`.

## qmd (optional, for large wikis)

[qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) is a local semantic search engine for Markdown files with BM25 + vector hybrid search. Useful when the wiki grows beyond ~100 pages and `wiki/index.md` scanning becomes slow.

```bash
pip install qmd
qmd collection add wiki/ --name my-wiki
qmd embed
qmd query "what are the tradeoffs of RAG vs wiki" --collection my-wiki
```

qmd also has an MCP server so LLMs can use it as a native tool.

## Marp — generating slide decks from wiki content

```markdown
---
marp: true
theme: default
---

# Slide title

Content here

---

# Next slide
```

Install the Marp plugin in Obsidian to preview/export directly.

## Generating charts

For quantitative analyses, ask the LLM to generate a matplotlib script and save to `outputs/charts/`:

```python
# outputs/charts/my-analysis.py
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# ... chart code ...
plt.savefig('outputs/charts/my-analysis.png')
```

Embed in a wiki article: `![[my-analysis.png]]`.

## Git workflow

The wiki is a git repo. Benefits:
- Version history for every article.
- Branching for experimental research directions.
- Audit files are tracked, so "who suggested this and when" is first-class.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "ingest: 3 papers on attention mechanisms"
git push
```

Keep large files (PDFs >10 MB, raw images at full resolution, video, model weights) in `.gitignore`. Use the raw file policy: pointer files in `raw/refs/`, not copies.

## Interactive HTML outputs

For complex analyses, the LLM can generate interactive HTML with JavaScript and save to `outputs/`. These can be opened in a browser or embedded in Obsidian with the HTML plugin.
